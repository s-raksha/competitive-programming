//https://leetcode.com/problems/final-prices-with-a-special-discount-in-a-shop/
/*
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop.

There is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount
equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i]. Otherwise, you will
not receive any discount at all.

Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop,
considering the special discount.
